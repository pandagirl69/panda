        In 1970 Norman E. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for a
        lifetime of work to feed a hungry world. Although a scientist with
        outstanding contributions, perhaps Dr. Borlaug's greatest achievement
        has been his unending struggle to integrate the various streams of
        agricultural research into viable technologies and to convince political
        leaders to bring these advances to fruition.
